# OCR - Optical Character Recognition

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology that converts different types of text-containing images (printed, handwritten, or scanned documents) into machine-readable text.

It allows computers to recognize and process text from images, PDFs, or scanned documents, making it editable and searchable.


ðŸ“Œ How OCR Works?
1. Image Preprocessing
   Enhancing contrast, removing noise, and correcting distortions.
2. Text Detection
   Identifying text regions in the image.
3. Character Segmentation
   Splitting text into individual characters or words.
4. Character Recognition
   Using AI models (CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers) to recognize characters.
5. Post-processing
   Correcting errors using spell-checking or language models.
